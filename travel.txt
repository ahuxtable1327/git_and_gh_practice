New Zealand

Shortly before moving to Colorado, I went on a vacation to New Zealand with a friend. We spent two weeks on a bus traveling around the country visiting different cities and going on various adventures.
A few of the adventures included:
 - Swimming with wild dolphins
 - Going to a refuge for kiwis; a native bird that is flightless and has now become endangered because of this.
 - Going on a boat tour of the Milford Sound, a fiord in the southwest region of the southern island.
